        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Greetings! I am Mudit Sengar, a Junior Undergraduate student pursuing
          a B.Tech in Civil Engineering at the esteemed Indian Institute of
          Technology, Kanpur. Hailing from the culturally vibrant city of
          Bhopal, I am currently immersing myself in the academic challenges and
          diverse experiences that IIT Kanpur offers.
        </p>
        <h2>Academic Journey</h2>
        <p>
          My academic journey has been marked by a consistent pursuit of
          excellence. Presently maintaining a CPI of 7.45 out of 10, I completed
          my CBSE(XII) from GVN The Global School, Bhopal, with an impressive
          96.4%. My passion for learning and dedication is further underscored
          by achieving a stellar rank of 4760 in JEE Advanced and securing All
          India Rank 6424 in the common merit list of JEE Mains.
        </p>

        <h2>Technical Proficiency</h2>
        <p>
          Beyond the academic sphere, I have delved into the dynamic world of
          technology and analytics. Engaging in projects like "Art of Analytics"
          during the SOCE Summer Project, I honed my skills in Python, utilizing
          machine learning models to predict housing prices and wine quality
          with impressive accuracies of 92% and 82.4%, respectively. My
          exploration extends to the realm of 3D Art Development within the
          GameDev Club, where I optimized model creation and achieved a
          rendering optimization of up to 32%.
        </p>
        <h2>Leadership and Initiatives</h2>
        <p>
          Demonstrating my commitment to leadership, I am currently an Organizer
          for Events in
          <a href="https://udghosh.org.in/" target="_blank">Udghoshâ€™23</a>,
          leading a 4-tier team of 100+ students responsible for organizing
          formal and informal events during the fest. My initiatives include
          launching the first-ever grand E-Sports tournament with 10,000+
          participation and reaching 40,000+. I initiated "<a
            href="https://udghosh.org.in/social"
            target="_blank"
            >Udaan</a

          diversity and inclusivity.

          In my role as a Leader in the

            >E-Sports Society</a
          >, I have led a 2-tier team of 25 secretaries, conducting various club
          activities throughout the year. Notably, I successfully organized the
          Asphalt League, BGMI fest, and other events for the IIT Kanpur campus
          community, significantly increasing the society's reach through
          official YouTube channel streams.

        <p>
          My technical skills encompass a range of programming languages,
          including C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, LATEX, and Python. Proficient
          in various software and libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib,
          Blender, and more, I bring a holistic approach to problem-solving and
          project execution.
        </p>
        <h2>Beyond Academics</h2>
        <p>
          Outside the academic sphere, I have showcased my abilities on diverse
          platforms. I secured the first position in a Valorant tournament
          during E-Sports Extravaganza, demonstrating my teamwork and critical
          thinking skills. Moreover, my passion for basketball earned me a
          silver medal in an Intra School Basketball Tournament.
        </p>
        <h2>Volunteering</h2>
        <p>
          In line with my commitment to social responsibility, I have
          volunteered for

          society.

          As I continue my academic journey and explore diverse interests, I
          remain open to new challenges and opportunities. My passion for
          environmental engineering and burgeoning interest in web development
          reflect my commitment to creating a positive impact on the world.
